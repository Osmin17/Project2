TROUBLESHOOTING BLANK PAGE
=========================

If your Football Career Clicker site is still blank, here are the most likely causes and how to fix them:

1. **Check the Browser Console for Errors**
   - Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console tab).
   - Look for any red error messages. These will tell you exactly what is wrong (e.g., missing file, JS error, etc).

2. **Check for 404 Errors (Missing Files)**
   - In the Network tab, look for any files that fail to load (404 Not Found), especially `main.js` or images.
   - Make sure your browser is loading the correct `index.html` and `main.js` from `/workspaces/Project2/`.

3. **Make Sure You Are Running a Local Server**
   - You must use a local server (like Live Server in VS Code) and visit http://localhost:5500/ (or the port your server uses).
   - Double-clicking the HTML file will NOT work for JS modules or dynamic imports.

4. **Check for JS Execution**
   - You should see an alert box that says 'JS loaded!'.
   - If you do NOT see this, your script is not being loaded. Check the script tag in your HTML and the file path.

5. **Check for Element IDs**
   - The JS expects these elements in your HTML: `career-container`, `club-logo`, `club-name`, `roll-club`, `clicker-section`, `goal-count`, `score-btn`, `transfer-section`, `transfer-btn`, `shop-section`, `player-chosen`.
   - If any are missing, the JS will not work. Double-check your `index.html`.

6. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Sometimes browsers cache old JS. Do a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R).

7. **Try a Different Browser**
   - Sometimes browser extensions or settings block JS. Try Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

If you still have issues, copy any error messages from the browser console and share them for further help.
